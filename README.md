## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1) Neatest and most efficient code written thus far  
2) Use combined selector (chained selectors) instead of unnecessary Classes/Ids  
3) Adhered to best practice for h1-h6 heading semantics  

### Continued development

1) Smarter way to make responsive dimensions (height and width) when switching between mobile and desktop (using media queries).  
2) Changing text (format) when switching between mobile and desktop (using media queries).  

### Useful resources
